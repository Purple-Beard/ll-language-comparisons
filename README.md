## "Ouroboros Programs", or Quine-Relays

A quine is a computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output.
The quine concept can be extended to multiple levels of recursion, giving rise to "ouroboros programs", or quine-relays. This should not be confused with multiquines.
